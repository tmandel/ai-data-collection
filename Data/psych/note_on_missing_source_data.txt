Note: 

The psychology data source file "pdpr99ve20_pd1.csv" is not included in this repo because we are not allowed to publically distribute the source data.

So, one cannot run the psychData.py script that analyzes the data to generate the condensed JSON file we use as input.

If you want to access the original data file, please request it from PsychData:

"A comparison of magnitude estimations and category judgments. Primary data."
